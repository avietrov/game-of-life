# Set up

Seems straightforward with https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/
I'm running the script and accepting allthe defaults.

# IDE
Using old good vim with LSP. 
JetBrain's fleet does not support Haskell ATM.


# Guide
Found this guide:
https://dzone.com/articles/game-life-haskell

Which is good enough, as I add more languages to this repo I'll learn new tricks and good ways of implementing it.
For now, I'm just following the guide. On the second pass through the languages I will improve the implementation.
